My goal is to become a full stack developer. My priorities are developing web applications in JavaScript. My strengths are maximum involvement in the project, diligence and perseverance. I strive to become an experienced web developer in order to bring maximum value to the project.

        { if (str[ i ] === str[j]) return false; }
     }
    return true;
}
```

#### **_Experience:_**
A python project for writing a program to get weather data in any city in the world. I used the pyOWM module (binding the API client of this portal to my code with the ability to request the weather).
